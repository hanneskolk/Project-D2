# Project-D2 - Hannes Kolk, Erik Kippus

We created this project with the goal of helping students get their driver's license, by providing insight about significant factors which might improve their odds. Our objectives were analysis of driving school exam success rates based on driving school choice, frequent mistakes and exam locations.

This repository is fairly simple. The folder "data" contains our initial datasets, which we used in our project. The datasets contain information on exams for years 2021 - 2024 (the dataset for 2024 is not complete, as the year has not yet ended, this did not harm our process). Then we have the folder "plots", which contains our work. The folder "code" has all the python codes, which take data, process it and visualise it on graphs. The graphs are visible in the "visuals" folder, where each of our goals has a .svg file with the graph. The repository also features our project report.
