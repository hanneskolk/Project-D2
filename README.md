# Project-D2 - Hannes Kolk, Erik Kippus

We created this project with the goal of helping students get their driver's license, by providing insight about significant factors which might improve their odds. Our objectives were analysis of driving school exam success rates based on driving school choice, frequent mistakes and exam locations.

This repository is fairly simple. The folder "data" contains our initial datasets, which we used in our project. The datasets contain information on exams for years 2021 - 2024 (the dataset for 2024 is not complete, as the year has not yet ended, this did not harm our process). Then we have the folder "plots", which contains our work. The folder "code" has all the python codes, which take data, process it and visualise it on graphs. The graphs are visible in the "visuals" folder, where each of our goals has a .svg file with the graph. The repository also features our project report.

To replicate the analysis conducted in this project, follow these steps:
  1.  Clone the Repository: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
  2.  Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries: pandas and matplotlib. You can install them using pip: pip install pandas matplotlib
  3.  Navigate to the Appropriate Directory: After cloning the repository, navigate to the plots folder, and then to the code subfolder.
  4.  Run the Python Scripts: Execute any of the Python files in the code folder using a Python environment or kernel. Each script generates a specific plot as shown in the project poster.

By following these steps, you can reproduce all the analyses and visualizations presented in the project.
